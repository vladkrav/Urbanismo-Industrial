# GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION OF INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSE.
The plot and the program of needs of an industrial warehouse dedicated to printing are developed.
It is necessary to develop the situation plan that resolves the implementation and distribution of the building, in such a way that it guarantees the circulation of trucks, accessibility to warehouses, transit of workers and customers, production control, etc.

There is a plot of 60 m x 25 m with accesses in both alignments, with attachment on one of the sides.

The interior of the building must be distributed to the main premises that affect the activity carried out in the establishment.

## TABLE OF URBAN CONDITIONS:
**MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY:** 50 %.

**MAXIMUM BUILDABLE:** 0.6 $m^2$ / 1 $m^2$.

**MINIMUM SIDE SETBACK:** 5 m.

**MINIMUM FRONT SETBACK:** 5 m.

## DESCRIPTION OF ENCLOSURE LAYERS
* Basement: precast concrete wall with 25 cm thickness. Height 1,5 m above ground.
* From basement to the meeting with the roof, lightweight 50 mm - thick sandwich panel cladding on the facades's purlin structure on the outside, 1/2 - foot-thick masonry sheet. Interior lining with 30 mm thermal insulation of high-density extruded polystyrene panel and double laminated plasterboard inside. The facade purlins will be type C 180.4 made of galvanized steel. 
* In the cover parapet, the same enclosure as the facade on the outside and simple sheet metal on the inside. 
* Roof based on 80 mm thick sandwich panel on roof straps, as specified in the structural calculation.
* Forging of the first floor of offices according to structural hypotesis. 
* Foundation by isolated footings joined by a 25 x 25 cm brace beam with 4Ã˜16 reinforcement.
* Soil in contact with the ground: screed e = 15 cm reinforced with mesh 30.30.6

## IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRE PROTECTION OF THE INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENT

The content of the warehouses is printing material. It is not manufactured, only mixing, packing and storage. 

With this information, the fire load by rooms and total resultant must be calculated. Evaluate type of instrinsic risk. Sectorization and evacuation of occupants must be resolved. Establish degree of protection of the structure.

## EVACUATION OF WATER FROM THE INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSE

The drawing will be made with the layout of the network, together with the calculation with specifications of:
- Number of deck drains.
- Gutter diameter.
- Diameter and number of downspouts, with a name for each one. 
- Diameter and specifications of collectors. The urbanization (parking spaces) must also be included in the collection of rainwater.
- Connection diameter. The discharge will be made at a height between 40 and 80 cm from the bottom of the sanitation network. The bottom of the first chest of the route is assumed to be 50 cm deep.

All the elements must be differentiated and labeled on the layout, including manholes, percentage drop, etc. 

The public sanitation network runs along the axis of the roads at a depth of 2 m. the feasibility of the connection must be justified.
