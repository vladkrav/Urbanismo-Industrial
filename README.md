# GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION OF INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENT.
The plot and the program of needs of an industrial establishment dedicated to printing are developed.
It is necessary to develop the situation plan that resolves the implementation and distribution of the building, in such a way that it guarantees the circulation of trucks, accessibility to warehouses, transit of workers and customers, production control, etc.

There is a plot of 60 m x 25 m with accesses in both alignments, with attachment on one of the sides.

The interior of the building must be distributed to the main premises that affect the activity carried out in the establishment.

## TABLE OF URBAN CONDITIONS:
**MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY:** 50 %.

**MAXIMUM BUILDABLE:** 0.6 $m^2$ / 1 $m^2$.

**MINIMUM SIDE SETBACK:** 5 m.

**MINIMUM FRONT SETBACK:** 5 m.

## IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRE PROTECTION OF THE INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENT

The content of the warehouses is printing material. It is not manufactured, only mixing, packing and storage. 

With this information, the fire load by rooms and total resultant must be calculated. Evaluate type of instrinsic risk. Sectorization and evacuation of occupants must be resolved. Establish degree of protection of the structure.
